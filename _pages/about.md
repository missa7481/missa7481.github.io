Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the University of Maryland (UMD), currently conducting research as part of [Dr. Baecher's](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/244/Gregory-B-Baecher) research group and involved in the [OSD Minerva Project](https://ischool.umd.edu/news/mark-austin-is-pi-for-new-dod-minerva-research-initiative-project/) (PIs: [Dr. Mark A. Austin](https://isr.umd.edu/clark/faculty/241/Mark-A-Austin) & [Dr. Jennifer Golbeck](https://ischool.umd.edu/directory/jennifer-golbeck/)). I am also a research collaborator with the [Risk-Informed Solutions in Engineering Laboratory](https://riselab.umd.edu/). I received my Ph.D degree in Summer 2024, following an M.S. in civil engineering with a focus project management from UMD in 2020 and an M.S. in civil engineering with a focus on structure engineering from San Franciso State University (SFSU) in 2018. 

My academic work has been published or is forthcoming in esteemed journals such as the <span style="color: blue"> *Sustainable Cities and Society*, the *International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction*, the *ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology*, the *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, the *Journal of Construction Engineering and Management*, the *Fire Safety Journal*, and the *Journal of Air Transport Management*,</span> among others. These [research](research) efforts address the nexus of environmental impact, urban infrastructure, and social behavior through big data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The goal is to foster resilient and sustainable development, thus contributing to a better future for all. I also have [teaching](teaching) experience in various engineering courses and have mentored both undergraduate and graduate students.
