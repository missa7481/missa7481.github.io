Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the deparment of civil and environmental engineering (CEE) at the University of Maryland (UMD), currently conducting reserach as part of [Dr.Baecher's](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/244/Gregory-B-Baecher) esteemed reserach group. I am also a research collaborator with the 
[Risk-Informed Solutions in Engineering Laboratory](https://riselab.umd.edu/). I received M.S.in civil engineering in project management from UMD in 2020 and M.S.in civil engineering in structure engineering from San Franciso State University (SFSU) in 2018. 

My academic work has been published or is forthcoming in esteemed journals such as the *International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction*, the *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, the *Journal of Construction Engineering and Management*, the *Fire Safety Journal*, and the J*ournal of Air Transport Management*, among others. These [researches](research) focus on harnessing crowdsourced information to enhance informed decision-making in emergency management spanning a spectrum from disaster response and pandemic preparedness to humanitarian crises. The ultimate goal is to play a role in fostering resilient and sustainable communities, thus contributing to a better future for all. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in in a variety of engineering courses and have mentored students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
