Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the University of Maryland (UMD), currently conducting research as part of [Dr. Baecher's](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/244/Gregory-B-Baecher) esteemed research group. I am also a research collaborator with the [Risk-Informed Solutions in Engineering Laboratory](https://riselab.umd.edu/). I received an M.S. in civil engineering in project management from UMD in 2020 and an M.S. in civil engineering in structure engineering from San Franciso State University (SFSU) in 2018. 

My academic work has been published or is forthcoming in esteemed journals such as the <span style="color: blue">*International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction*, the *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, the *Journal of Construction Engineering and Management*, the *Fire Safety Journal*, and the *Journal of Air Transport Management*,</span> among others. These [researches](research) focus on harnessing crowdsourced information to enhance informed decision-making in emergency management, spanning a spectrum from disaster response and pandemic preparedness to humanitarian crises. The ultimate goal is to play a role in fostering resilient and sustainable communities, thus contributing to a better future for all. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in various engineering courses and have mentored undergraduate and graduate students.
